# Contributing

## Style Guide

All pull requests to the python source must follow [PEP
8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) conventions.

All methods and functions must be in snake_case and not camelCase. All
code must also be formatted with `black` and it's default settings.

## Documentation

You must document any and all objects, modules, packages and namespaces you define.
You must use also use the default [sphinx format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html#the-sphinx-docstring-format) for docstrings.

## Tests

You are responsible for writing tests for any code you contribute. We use
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing. Once you've written
your tests, you should run tox to ensure that your tests pass on all supported
python versions.

## Towncrier

To aid with the generation of `CHANGELOG.rst` as well as the releases
changelog we use towncrier.

You will need to install towncrier and OpenGrammar from source before
making changelog additions. You can learn about how to install the package
for contribution in the [documentation](https://opengrammar.rtfd.io/en/stable/installation.html).

For every pull request made to this project, there should be a short
explanation of the change under changes/ with the following format:
`{pull_request_number}.{type}.rst`,

Possible types are:

-   breaking: Signifying a backwards incompatible change.
-   feature: Signifying a new feature.
-   bugfix: Signifying a bugfix.
-   doc: Signifying a documentation improvement.
-   deprecation: Signifying a deprecation or removal of public API.

For changes that do not fall under any of the above cases, please
specify the lack of the changelog in the pull request description so
that a maintainer can skip the job that checks for newly added
fragments.

Best way to create the fragments is to run towncrier create
`{pull_request_number}.{type}.rst` after creating the pull request, edit
the created file and committing the changes.

Multiple fragment types can be created per pull request if it covers
multiple areas.

## Pull Requests

We follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as
our workflow when creating pull requests. It is a neater and easier way
to manage changes. You are also responsible for writing tests(where
applicable) if you are contributing to a core module. If we see an area
of code that requires tests, then we will not accept the PR until you
write a test for that area of code. Tests ensure long term stability.

Also note that there are CI checks in place. If any automated tests
fail, please rework and resubmit your PR.
